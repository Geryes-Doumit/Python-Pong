## Playing the game
This is a two-player game ! <br>
The player on the left controls his paddle with Z and S. <br>
The player on the right controls his paddle with UP_ARROW and DOWN_ARROW. <br>

## Special Moves
There are special moves you can perform to confuse your enemy ! <br>
If you time it just right, you can either: <br>
- Increase the speed of the ball
- Increase the speed of the ball AND change its Y direction

It just depends on how you hit it ;)

Try it out !
